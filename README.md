# WikiPDF


These are a set of _nearly_ identical python scripts, which will download a list of wikipedia pages in PDF format without going through the hassle of clicking the "Download Page as PDF" link every time.

![wikipdfcolor](./img/wikipdfcolor.png)

> `wikipdf.py` 
The classic version. Uglier, less user friendly.

>`wikipdfcolor.py`
The **new and improved** version! As long as you've got a decent terminal (I recommend [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) for Windows users!),
you should have a lovely, color coded and more intuitive experience overall using the script!

So, here's how to use 'em:

How To Use the Script
---------------------

+ Save this git in the folder you'd like to run the code from. I'll say it's `C:\Users\{your_name}\Desktop` for this example.
+ Extract the zip file to a folder on the Desktop called `WikiPDF` or whatever you want.
+ See the file in there called `tst.txt`? That's how you need to format the .txt files for whatever pages you want to download.  
If they aren't on new lines, or written just like they are in their actual wikipedia page titles, you may see errors.
+ Run `wikipdf.py` or `wikipdfcolor.py` - _your choice_. A console window will pop up, asking you to enter the folder location for the textfile you'd like to parse is.
+ If you've done these steps right, just hit `Enter` and it will work fine.
+ It will then list any and all `.txt` files present in that directory. This is in case you have more than one and need to choose a specific  
option.
+ Type in `tst` or whatever the file name you have is and press enter.

**BOOM!**

The magic begins!
